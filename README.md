# scMUG: Deep clustering analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data on multiple gene functional modules



# Overview

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by providing gene expression data at the single-cell level. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq allows identification of different cell types within a given tissue, leading to a more nuanced comprehension of cell functions. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data presents challenges due to its sparsity and high dimensionality. To address these challenges, we introduce the scMUG pipeline, which incorporates gene functional module (GFM) information to enhance scRNA-seq clustering analysis. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, cell representation generation, cell-cell similarity matrix construction, and clustering analysis. The scMUG pipeline also introduces a novel similarity measure that combines local density and global distribution in the latent cell representation space. As far as we can tell, this is the first attempt to integrate gene functional associations into scRNA-seq clustering analysis. We curated nine human scRNA-seq datasets to evaluate our scMUG pipeline. With the help of gene functional information and the novel similarity measure, the clustering results from scMUG pipeline present deep insights into functional relationships between gene expression patterns and cellular heterogeneity. In addition, our scMUG pipeline also presents comparable or better clustering performances than other state-of-the-art methods. 

# Flowchart

Flowchart of scMUG. (A) Raw scRNA-seq data was preprocessed with statistical filters. Gene co-expression network was established using filtered expression profiles. Core sub-graphs were extracted. GFMs(Gene Functional Modules) were identified. (B) Cell representations are established by ZINB-loss based autoencoders in every GFM respectively. (C) Constructing cell-cell global distribution similarity matrix and local density similarity matrix. (D) Cell clustering analysis by spectral clustering with the combination of global and local similarity.

# Result

The results are saved in the "./outputs/" folder, including the latent value, the predicted labels, and the benchmark results measured by ACC, ARI and NMI.

## Post-hoc C/D factorial test

The saved 32-dimensional AE and DMKCN latents can be reused to cross several
block-C `(alpha, beta)` pairs with spectral clustering and k-means on affinity
rows. This test does not retrain either block-B model.

```bash
python3 ablation_block_c_d.py \
  --dataset li \
  --cluster_number 9 \
  --seeds 1111,2222,3333 \
  --repeat 1 \
  --latents-autoencoder outputs_adapter_pilot/li/latents_ae.joblib \
  --latents-dmkcn outputs_adapter_pilot/li/latents_dmkcn__spectral_dense_d32.joblib \
  --outfile outputs_adapter_pilot/li/cd_grid_alpha_d.tsv \
  --alpha-beta-grid 0.01:1,0.1:1,1:1
```

The detailed and aggregated outputs are written to `cd_grid_alpha_d.tsv` and
`cd_grid_alpha_d_summary.tsv`. Use `run_cd_grid.slurm` to run Darmanis and Li as
a CPU-only SLURM array from their existing pilot outputs.
